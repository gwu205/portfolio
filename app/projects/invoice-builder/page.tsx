        Sollective is a vetted freelancer matching platform in Japan, connecting
        highly skilled freelancers with companies looking to expand their
        business operations. In addition to matching, Sollective aims to support
        the future of freelance work in Japan through community events and
        made-for-freelance workflow tools.
      </p>
      <h3 className="section-heading">The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Freelancers often face challenges managing invoices due to their lack of
        financial expertise or familiarity with legal requirements. Existing
        tools in the market are typically tailored to back-office staff and
        finance professionals, making them inaccessible or too complex for
        novice users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team set out to build an invoice builder that addresses these key
        considerations:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Ease of Use and Education:</strong>
          <br />
          The tool needed to simplify invoice creation for freelancers
          unfamiliar with accounting practices. It also had to educate users
          about legal obligations, particularly the nuances of Japanese tax law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong>
          <br />
          Japanese tax regulations introduced specific requirements, such as the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/zeimokubetsu/shohi/keigenzeiritsu/invoice_about.htm"
            target="_blank"
            rel="nofollow noreferrer"

          >
            Qualified Invoice System
          </a>
          , which mandated detailed tax breakdowns. Additionally, laws like the
          tax withholding system required certain freelancers to account for tax
          payment based on their work type.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These challenges demanded a solution that was both accessible and
        compliant with Japan’s legal standards.
      </p>
      <h3 className="section-heading">The Solution</h3>
      <p className="subheading">Taking an opinionated design approach</p>
      <p>
        We chose to focus on the primary audience: freelancers in Japan with
        limited financial knowledge. Rather than attempting to cater to all
        market segments, we designed a streamlined and guided user experience.
      </p>
      <Image

        height={1504}
        width={2157}
        alt="freee UI"
        className="w-full h-auto"
      />
      <p className="subheading">Comparative Insights: Freee</p>
      <p>
        We analyzed market leaders like <i>freee</i>, whose products cater to
        back-office professionals. While robust, their interfaces were
        overwhelming for first-time users, a point frequently mentioned during
        user interviews. Freelancers found it difficult to understand legal
        documentation requirements due to cluttered layouts and excessive menu
        options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal was the opposite:{" "}
        <b>create a simple, guided, and intuitive experience</b>.
      </p>
      <p className="subheading">Pre-Creation Flow for Japanese Users</p>
      <p className="py-7 md:py-20 px-5 md:px-12 font-medium md:font-light text-lg md:text-4xl/snug text-slate-400 bg-white">
        How might we{" "}
        <span className="text-purple-400">
          ensure that our users are well-informed and aware of all the
          information they are required to include according to the new tax law?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        To address the complexity of invoice requirements, we implemented a
        pre-creation flow. This guided users through key steps to collect
        essential information, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scope of work.</li>
        <li>Registration status with the Qualified Invoice System.</li>
        <li>Client details and payment dates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Leveraging existing user data from Sollective’s platform, we reduced
        cognitive load by pre-selecting options where possible, ensuring clarity
        without sacrificing functionality.
      </p>

        src="/images/projects/invoices-create.png"
        height={883}
        width={1213}
        alt="invoice create"
        className="w-full h-auto"
      />
      <p className="subheading">Streamlining Administrative Tasks</p>
      <p>
        During interviews, freelancers shared that they often relied on
        spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) for invoice creation. Their reasons
        included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiarity with spreadsheet interfaces.</li>
        <li>Confidence in established workflows.</li>
        <li>Lack of awareness of more advanced tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We aligned the tool’s design with these expectations while introducing
        improvements:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clear workflows to reduce errors.</li>
        <li>Pre-filled fields to minimize manual input.</li>
        <li>Guided steps to simplify complex tasks.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="section-heading">Designing the Interface</h3>
      <p className="subheading">Balancing User and Recipient Needs</p>
      <p>The tool had to serve two distinct audiences:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Freelancers creating invoices.</li>
        <li>Accountants/back-office staff receiving them.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To achieve this, we implemented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Separate contexts for editing and viewing/exporting.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Editing modes focused on intuitive input methods.</li>
            <li>Export views ensured compliance and professionalism.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Familiar design elements</b> aligned with tools freelancers already
          used.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Image
        src="/images/projects/invoices-edit.jpg"
        height={1200}
        width={1800}
        alt="invoice edit"
        className="w-full h-auto"
      />
      <h3 className="section-heading">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Freelancers praised the tool for its simplicity and clarity, noting it
        was more approachable than traditional accounting software. The design
        struck a balance between educational value and functional ease,
        empowering users to spend less time on administrative tasks and more on
        meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through iterative testing and refinement, the invoice builder became a
        practical, legally compliant, and user-friendly solution tailored to the
        unique needs of freelancers in Japan.
